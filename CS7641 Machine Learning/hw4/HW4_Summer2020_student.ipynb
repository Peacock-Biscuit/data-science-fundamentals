    "- Questions marked with <span style=\"color:blue\">**[P]**</span> are programming only and should be submitted to the autograder. Questions marked with <span style=\"color:green\">**[W]**</span> may required that you code a small function or generate plots, but should **NOT** be submitted to the autograder. It should be submitted on the writing portion of the assignment on gradescope\n",

    "    * util.py\n",
    "    * decision_tree.py\n",
    "    * random_forest.py\n",
    "    * NN.py\n",
    "\n",
    "- All you will have to do is to copy your implementations of the classes \"DecisionTree\", \"RandomForest\", \"dlnet\" onto the respective files. We provided you different .py files and we added libraries in those files please DO NOT remove those lines and add your code after those lines. Note that these are the only allowed libraries that you can use for the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are allowed to make as many submissions until the deadline as you like. Additionally, note that the autograder tests each function separately, therefore it can serve as a useful tool to help you debug your code if you are not sure of what part of your implementation might have an issue. However, we encourage you to first debug locally since you will be able to solve most issues in the jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For the \"HW4 - Non-programming\" part, you will download your jupyter notbook as HTML, print it as a PDF from your browser and submit it on Gradescope. To download the notebook as html, click on \"File\" on the top left corner of this page and select \"Download as > HTML\". The non-programming part corresponds to Q5.**"

Based on what it was mentioned in the class, we randomly pick features in each split. We use a more general approach here to make the programming part easier. Let's randomly pick some features (70% percent of features) and grow the tree based on the pre-determined randomly selected features. Therefore, there is no need to find random features in each split.\n",

Since we are subsampling the datapoints with replacement, each individual decision tree in the random forests has some samples that were not used to train the tree. These samples are called \"out of bag.\" We first calculate the accuracy of each decision tree as the percentage of OOB samples that are correctly classified. Then we take the average of these accuracies to obtain the random forest's OOB score.\n",

    "(1) (5 points) We know that SVM can be used to classify linearly inseparable data by transforming it to a different feature space with a kernel $K(x, z) = \\phi(x)^T \\phi(z)$, where $\\phi(x)$ is a feature mapping. Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be $R^n \\times R^n$ kernels, $c \\in R^+$ be a positive constant., and $\\phi_1,\\phi_2 : R^n → R^d$ be the respective feature mappings of $K_1$ and $K_2$. Explain how to use $\\phi_1,\\phi_2$ to obtain the following kernels:   \n",
    "a. $K(x, z) = cK_1(x, z)$   \n",
    "b. $K(x, z) = K_1(x, z)K_2(x, z)$  \n",

Assume that constants (like $\\sqrt{2}$) are already calculated and given. What is the number of calculations required to find $K(x,z)$ through direct computation?  \n",

    "e. Consider the Radial Basis Kernel $$K(x,z) = exp ( - \\frac{||x - z||^2} {2\\sigma^2})$$. Is it possible to find a feature map in this case? Do you think it's necessary that an explicit feature map exists with all kernels?  "

In this excercise we minimize Cross Entropy (CE) loss, that represents on an intutive level, the distance between true data distribution and estimated distribution by neural network.
